# QDict
This is an open source Android dictionary application which support `stardict` format dictionaries.

## Fork information
This fork of [the original application](https://github.com/namndev/QDict) was created to incorporate patches,
which were not responded to by the upstream and so as to make it possible to include the application in the [F-Droid repository](https://f-droid.org).

The fork is not actively developed, i.e. no new features or bugfixes are planned,
however, all PRs are welcome and will be reviewed.

## Using dictionaries
QDict support 3 ways to search:  `Glob-style pattern matching`,  `Fuzzy query` and `Full-text` search.

Stardict dictionaries are not included in the application and should be obtained separately.

Dictionaries should be placed in `/sdcard/QDict/dicts`.
Each dictionary should be placed into a separate subfolder, for instance `/sdcard/QDict/dicts/dict-name`.
It's recommended to only use alphanumeric filenames.
